# How would you describe David to someone who isn't familiar with the Bible?

<!--
* The Dura-Europos synagogue consistutes of of the oldest known examples of Jewish art.
  * One striking thing about this depiction of David is that he is portrayed as an essentially Greek or Roman figure.
  * This David takes the form of a beardless Hellenistic youth and is anointed by a toga-wearing Samuel.
* The depiction in the synagogue is joined by a nearby third century Christian church, which also features depictions of David, notably his battle with Goliath.
  * For more on this, see [Michael Peppard](https://www.ancientjewreview.com/read/2016/4/18/david-as-warrior-at-dura-europos).

# “Lines to the divine David,” ca. 10th c.
Be silent, Orpheus; thy lyre throw aside, O Hermes.\
The tripod at Delphi hath sunk into oblivion for evermore.\
For us David doth now play the Spirit's lyre,\
The hidden things of God's mysteries he revealeth;\
A multitude of ancient wonders he narrateth;\
Of the Creator of creation doth he move one to sing.\
Saving all those men he initiateth, as he writeth his verses,\
Sinners doth he bring to desire repentance.\
Among other teachings, to the throng doth he declare the Judge's judgments.\
The purging, he doth teach, of soulful sinnings.

<!--
* This poem is commonly attributed to Ioannes Geometres, a Byzantine poet of the 10th century.
* David is presented as a new Orpheus or Hermes, a replacement for pagan prophetic lyricism.

<!--
* This portrayal utilizes the atheletic ideal of the Renaissance-era revival of the *classical* ideal.
* David is dragged through time into a 16th century appropriation of a 5th century BC Greek ideal.
* This particular work has become, in turn, an exemplar of that Renaissance appropriation.

# 2 Sam 7:5–16
“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: … When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom….
And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me.
Your throne shall be established forever.’”

# 2 Sam 12:7--10
“Thus says the <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul; I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah\.\.\.\.
Why have you despised the word of the <sc>Lord</sc>, to do what is evil in his sight? \.\.\.
Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, for you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.”

# Psalm 89:29–35
“I will establish [David’s] offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens.
If his children forsake my law… then I will punish their transgression..., but I will not remove from him my steadfast love....
I will not lie to David.”

# Jer 33:14–16
“In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line; he will do what is just and right in the land.’”

# Ezekiel 34:23–24
“I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David\.\.\.\. he shall feed them and be their shepherd.”

# Amos 9:11
On that day I will raise up the booth of David that is fallen... and rebuild it as in the days of old.

<!--
* The supreme irony of David's consistent association with Israel's restoration is that David's own violence doomed his house to destruction.
* David's line is perpetually afflicted by violence and conflict, but nevertheless it is David and his line who will apparently bind up the flock of Israel and participate in the nation's restoration after exile.
* Notably, Amos 9:11 acknowledges the decrepit state of the Davidic house; just as God said to David "I will build you a house," he here promises to rebuild that house, here described as a "tent."
  * This evokes David's protestation that God should not dwell in a tent, but ought to have a *house*.

# 2 Sam 23:1--5
Now these are the last words of David:\
The oracle of David, son of Jesse,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oracle of the man whom God exalted,\
the anointed of the God of Jacob,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the favorite of the Strong One of Israel:\
The spirit of the <sc>Lord</sc> speaks through me,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his word is upon my tongue\.\.\.\.\
For he has made with me an everlasting covenant,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ordered in all things and secure.\
Will he not cause to prosper\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my help and my desire?

# 1 Chron 28:11--19
Then David gave his son Solomon the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;
and the plan of all that he had \[by the Spirit\]\.\.\.\.
\[David then said to Solomon,\] “All this, in writing at the <sc>Lord</sc>’s direction, he made clear to me—the plan of all the works.”

<!--
* Many English translations have "all that he had in mind" in v. 12, but I opt for the more prophetically-tinged "by the Spirit" here (MT: ותבנית כל אשר היה ברוח עמו; LXX: ὃ εἶχεν
ἐν πνεύματι αὐτοῦ).
  * On this point, see Jürg Hutzli,“David in the Role of a Second Moses – The Revelation of the Temple-Model (Tabnît) in 1 Chronicles 28”, in *Chronicles and the Priestly Literature of the Hebrew Bible*, ed. Jaeyoung Jeon and Louis C. Jonker, *BZAW* 528 (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2021), 325–26.

# 11Q5 27.1--11: “David's Compositions”
And David, son of Jesse, was wise, and a light like the light of the sun, and learned,\
and discerning, and perfect in all his paths before God and men. And\
YHWH gave him a discerning and enlightened spirit. And he wrote psalms:\
three thousand six hundred; and songs to be sung before the altar over the perpetual\
offering of every day, for all the days of the year: three hundred\
and sixty-four; and for the sabbath offerings: fifty-two songs\.\.\.\.\
All these he spoke through the spirit of prophecy which had been given to him from before the Most High.

# Josephus, *Antiquities* 6.165--166
Then, taking the oil, with David looking on, \[Samouel\] smeared it on him and spoke softly in his ear, indicating that God had chosen him to rule as king\.\.\.\.
The Deity then abandoned Saoul and went over to David.
Once the divine spirit transferred to him, he began to prophesy.
A certain suffering beset Saoul and demons caused him to suffocate and choke\.\.\.\.

<!--
* 11Q5 not only portrays David as a divinely inspired prophet, but also amplifies his lyrical output far beyond the canonical psalms.
  * David becomes the superintendent of the liturgical calendar, providing songs for every day of the year.
* In Josephus's retelling of the story of David's anointing, David and Saul swap places, with David becoming the recipient of the divine spirit that is associated with kingship.
  * As a result, David prophesies while Saul is tormented by demons.

# CD 5.1--6
And concerning the prince it is said, **Let him not multiply wives to himself** (Deut 17:17).
But David had not read the sealed book of the Torah which was in the ark (of the Covenant), for it was not opened in Israel since the day of the death of Eleazar and Joshua and the elders who worshipped the Ashtoreth.
And what was (therein) revealed was hidden away until Zadok arose.
So the deeds of David were accepted—except for the murder of Uriah—for which God forgave him.

# 4QMMT<sup>c</sup> 25--32
Remember David, who was a man of the pious ones, [and] he, too, [was] freed from many afflictions and was forgiven.

# Acts 2:29--32
“Fellow Israelites, I may say to you confidently of our ancestor David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would put one of his descendants on his throne.
Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘He was not abandoned to Hades,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor did his flesh experience corruption.’\
This Jesus God raised up, and of that all of us are witnesses.

# Acts 4:24--25
When they heard it, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and everything in them, it is you who said by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Why did the Gentiles rage,\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples imagine vain things?...’”

# *Ascension of Isaiah* 11.2
And I saw a woman of the family of David the prophet whose name was Mary, and she was a virgin and was betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, a carpenter, and he also was of the seed and family of the righteous David of Bethlehem in Judah.

<!--
* Typically dated from 80 to 120s.
* Uses the figure of Isaiah as a vehicle for Christianized Jewish prophetic visions.

# *Midr. Teh.* 1:2
The foremost among Prophets—he is Moses... the foremost among kings—he is David\.\.\.\.
***You find that whatever Moses did, David did.***
As Moses led Israel out of Egypt, so David led Israel out of servitude to Goliath\.\.\.\.
As Moses became king in Israel and in Judah, ... so David became king in Israel and in Judah\.\.\.\.
As Moses built an altar, so David built an altar.
As the one brought offerings, so the other brought offerings.
As Moses gave five books of laws to Israel, so David gave five Books of Psalms to Israel.

# *Lamentations Rab.* 2.22
R. Levi said, “There was a harp suspended above David’s bed, and when midnight came, the north wind would blow upon it, and it made a melody on its own\.\.\.\.
Now when David would hear the sound, he would get up and study the Torah.
When the Israelites heard that David was studying the Torah, they would say, ‘If David, King of Israel, is studying the Torah, how much more should we!’
They immediately got up and studied the Torah.”

Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1959).
* *Lamentations Rabbah* translation taken from Jacob Neusner, *Rabbi David: A Documentary Catalogue*, Studies in Judaism (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 2012), 84. Neusner includes this section of Lamentations Rabbah in his catalogue of texts from Ruth Rabbah.
* While the rabbis don't completely turn David into a rabbinic sage, here he acts as a model of sage-like Torah study for Israel.
  * Far from not reading the Torah or being ignorant of biblical law, David has a somewhat supernatural alarm clock that enables his disciplined Torah study!
